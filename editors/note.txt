Note: The 4 editor is only available for windows.

I recommend using my work-in-progress switch editor.
It can run on emulator and real hardware.
You can find it in editors/switch/

To use on emulator, place editor.nro in your switch roms folder
To use on switch, place editor.nro in your /switch folder


A 3ds editor is planned, but is still a long way from being released.

Hope you enjoy
